# Brew Competition Online Entry & Management
Working repository of BCOE&M.

The Brew Competition Online Entry and Management (BCOE&M) system is an online application to assist homebrew competition hosts (of the beer/mead/cider variety) to collect, store, and manage their competition entry, organization, and scoring data.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is knowing who has entered what and how many, organizing judging 
efficiently, and reporting the results of the competition in a timely manner. BCOE&M provides a single online interface to collect entry and participant data, organize judging tables and assignments, input scoring data, and report the results.

The best part: *BCOE&M is free and open-source*. Now improved with version 2.0.0!

[Version 2.0.0 is now available for download] (https://github.com/geoffhumphrey/brewcompetitiononlineentry/releases). If you need help, [installation] (http://www.brewcompetition.com/install-instructions) and [upgrade] (http://www.brewcompetition.com/upgrade-instructions) instructions are available.

**Upcoming Changes**
