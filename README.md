**About**
**********************************************************************
The Brew Competition Online Entry and Management (BCOE&M) system is an 
online application to assist homebrew competition hosts (of the beer 
variety) to collect, store, and manage their competition entry and 
scoring data.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is 
knowing who has entered what and how many, organizing judging 
efficiently, and reporting the results of the competition in a timely 
manner. BCOE&M provides a single online interface to collect entry and 
participant data, organize judging tables and assignments, input  
scoring data, and report the results.

BCOE&M is free and open-source.

**Upcoming Changes**
**********************************************************************
Conversion to v2.0 - complete overhaul of the user interface to 
leverage the popular Bootstrap 3 (http://getbootstrap.com) framework.

Needless to say, the commits are NOT FOR PRODUCTION!! 

Bugs are still present!
