# Brew Competition Online Entry & Management

The Brew Competition Online Entry and Management (BCOE&M) system is an online application to assist homebrew competition hosts (of the beer/mead/cider variety) to collect, store, and manage their competition entry, organization, and scoring data.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is knowing who has entered what and how many, organizing judging 
efficiently, and reporting the results of the competition in a timely manner. BCOE&M provides a single online interface to collect entry and participant data, organize judging tables and assignments, input scoring data, and report the results.

The best part: BCOE&M is free and open-source. And soon to be new and improved with version 2.0.0!

**Upcoming Changes**
**********************************************************************
Next up: a complete overhaul of the user interface to leverage the popular Bootstrap 3 (http://getbootstrap.com) framework.
Following that: converting all mysql calls to mysqli for compatibility with future versions of php.

Needless to say, the commits housed here are NOT FOR PRODUCTION!! Bugs are still present. Fork and help out with the development!
